# Bisleri Water Bottle Challenge Game

**An interactive, browser-based fitness game built for Bisleri's exclusive activation at the TCS World 10K Bengaluru 2024 Marathon.**
Designed to combine hydration awareness, physical activity, and fun, this game transforms warm-ups into a challenge of balance, rhythm, and agility!

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Created in collaboration with **Bisleri International Pvt Ltd**, this project was the centerpiece of a three-day pre-marathon warm-up event. It introduced an innovative twist to traditional warm-up routines by prioritizing **controlled leg movement** and **balance** over raw speed.

Participants were encouraged to “fill” a digital water bottle by running or stepping in place — with **load sensors** detecting real-time motion and translating it into visible progress on-screen.

## 🔥 Key Features

* ⏱️ Animated countdown before gameplay starts
* 🕒 30-second in-game stopwatch
* 🏃 Responsive bottle-filling mechanic via keyboard input or sensor integration
* 🙌 Personalized win/lose message using player’s name
* 🔁 Auto-refresh after each round for continuous play
* ⚙️ Plug-and-play: Works seamlessly with or without hardware integration

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Enter your name to personalize the game.
3. Click **Start** and wait for the countdown.
4. Repeatedly press any key (or jog in place with sensors connected) to fill the bottle.
5. Beat the clock by filling the bottle before time runs out!

## 🧩 Tech + Hardware Integration

The game was initially designed to work with **load sensors** that detect running motion. During the live event, this created a **physically immersive** experience where participants interacted with a virtual Bisleri bottle through real-world movement.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** You can still simulate gameplay using your keyboard if you don’t have sensors.
